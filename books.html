                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    An entertaining read that I felt a connection to as Mythbusters was a part of my
                    childhood/adolescence.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    One of the main takeaways I got from reading it was that everyone has their thing; everyone is
                    creative in one way or another. That can take the form of sewing, cooking, programming, singing,
                    writing, model making, cosplay and so on. Everyone has interests they are "into" and that is
                    something to be
                    celebrated and embraced and shared. It takes vulnerability, but doing so you will find there are
                    others who share your passion. You will also find there are others who don't. But the more you
                    share, the more you will find.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Sharing was another big theme of the book. Share your visions, hopes, dreams, failures, ideas, and
                    knowledge. I loved the quote: "Knowledge is power, and the most powerful thing you can do with
                    knowledge is give it away." I am a supporter of sharing, even though I sometimes struggle with it.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    It was entertaining to step into Adam's mind and see his growth. From an impatient naieve youngster
                    to an impatient but seasoned adult, he calls out some of his growth and lessons learned.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    All the ideas and anecdotes he shares is his attempt to share some of the things he has learned to,
                    hopefully, help and encourage others to lean into their interests.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Everyone has their thing, and everyone can be creative. Lean into it, embrace your weirdness, and be
                    prepared to learn, grow, and share it.
