title: Why Your New Year's Resolutions Will Fail
---


There are 3 reasons why your new year's resolutions are destined to fail
1. Sir Isaac Newton
2. Habits
3. Cheese


For now, we are going to talk about why Newton thinks your goals are trash.


Newton wrote three laws, the first of which states the following:


```
1. An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
```

In an attempt to explain it to my 5-year-old: 

```
Things stay where they are or things keep moving until something applies a greater force on them in a given direction.
```

Applied to your New Year's resolutions:
```
You are going to keep doing what you are currently doing until you apply a greater force to your life in a direction.
```

Why? Because objects in our natural world tend to resist changes to their current state of motion. This is called **inertia**. And it is stubborn.

So, you want to make a change in your life this year? That is commendable. Getting started is probably the hardest part because it takes force greater than you are currently exerting and it takes direction which you may or may not currently have. And depending on the direction, it may take more or less force (segue to Newton's second law which we won't go into here).

But I believe in you. I really do.

They say a leopard can't change its spots. But your are not a leopard. Humans change every day. And you are a human...unless something has recently gone wrong.

Happy New Year! Time to pick a direction and start. First one step. Then another. And pretty soon, you'll be walking out the door.

Something to think about.
